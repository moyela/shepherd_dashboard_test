          Hi! My name is Wemi, I'm a fullstack engineer and this is where I make things on the web.
          Depending on the time of day you’d either find me reading about WebAssembly or watering and repotting one of my plants

          Previously, I worked on product development teams at Moniepoint building the client side of a personal banking application; 
          interned as a Systems Engineer at Babban Gona and worked on data sets for a computer vision algorithm built to help local partner farmers in northern Nigeria diagnose and treat cash crop diseases; 
          and worked as a Junior Editor at The Republic Journal heading an interview column and supporting company operations.

          I received my BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Lagos where my interests mostly focused on long distance communication systems. 
          My dissertation was on USSD-based smart meter monitoring and tariff collection as a more convenient electric tariff solution for households in Sub Saharan Africa and regions with infrastructure deficits and high USSD market penetration. 
          I collaborated with the following groups during my undergrad:

          <li>
              Google Developers Group, where I partnered up with other student developers and mentors on community management projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            AIESEC in Lagos, where I helped integrate global volunteers into local programs and projects in Lagos on the Incoming Global Volunteers team.
          </li>
          <li>
            PAADC, where I supported the partnerships, promotions, and communication teams on editorial consistency and voice as part of the Quality Control team.
          </li>

          I currently care for a small collection of 40 (at my last count) tropical ornamental plants and I’m having trouble finding time for all my remaining interests which include but are not limited to:

          Competitive cycling. I think bicycles are amazing for their simplicity and efficiency. I’m still not used to cycling as my go-to means of transport but you’ll be seeing me on the streets soon.
          
          I’m currently studying proportions in figurative art so I can improve the consistency and realism of my art. I honestly just want to draw realistic caricatures of my friends and family as presents.
