Hi Shepherd team! I'm Wemi and I was able to make a somewhat decent mockup of the sidebar and dashboard in the design document I was given.

I ended up only being able to spend a few hours working on this, and with more time I would have fleshed it out better in line with the mockup in the pdf.

I committed to sending this to Kehinde on Sunday, so I'll be stopping at this point.
