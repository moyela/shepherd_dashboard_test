Hi Kehinde!

I was able to make a somewhat decent mockup of the sidebar and dashboard in the design document I was given, although it's still incomplete.

I ended up only being able to spend a few hours working on this, and with more time I would have fleshed it out better in line with the mockup file

I committed to sending this to you by Sunday, so I'll be stopping at this point and sending it in.
